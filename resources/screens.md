The second interface change is that all images are now shown on a separate Graphics tab. This includes hi-res images, fonts, shapes, icons etc. The Data tab will instead display information pertaining to the image.

## Key Shortcuts
Any tab can be activated by pressing the key of the initial letter of the tab name. If the same key is pressed twice in succession then the second keypress causes the previously displayed tab to be reactivated.
