# Disk Browser ][
This is a rewrite of [DiskBrowser](https://github.com/dmolony/diskbrowser), using JavaFX
 and the new libraries ([AppBase](https://github.com/dmolony/AppBase),
  [AppleFileSystem](https://github.com/dmolony/AppleFileSystem) and
   [AppleFormat](https://github.com/dmolony/AppleFormat)). It is not yet ready
  for release. It's not even ready for parole.
  
  The goal is for DiskBrowser ][ to retain all the file display formats of
   DiskBrowser, but with a better interface and a more maintainable code base.
   
### Example Screens
This image shows the main interface change from DiskBrowser. Instead of separate tabs
 for each disk, the file tree expands each disk image to show its contents.

When a file is selected, and the Options pane is active, then options for that
 file type can be altered.

Extra file information has moved to the Extras tab.

The file tree can be filtered so that only the selected file types are shown.
