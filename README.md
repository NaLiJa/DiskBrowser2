# Disk Browser ][
This is a rewrite of [DiskBrowser](https://github.com/dmolony/diskbrowser), using JavaFX
 and the new libraries ([AppBase](https://github.com/dmolony/AppBase),
  [AppleFileSystem](https://github.com/dmolony/AppleFileSystem) and
   [AppleFormat](https://github.com/dmolony/AppleFormat)). It is not yet ready
  for release. It's not even ready for parole.
   
### Example Screens
This image shows the main interface change from DiskBrowser. Instead of separate tabs
 for each disk, the file tree expands each disk image to show its contents.
